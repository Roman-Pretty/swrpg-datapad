# SWRPG Datapad

Welcome to the **SWRPG Datapad**!

This datapad is a helpful resource for players and GMs of *Star Wars: Roleplaying Game (SWRPG)*. It provides quick references to the core mechanics of the game, designed to be a useful tool during your adventures in the *Star Wars* universe. 

## Overview

This datapad includes a range of rules references that are meant to act as reminders for key elements of the game. It's not a guide to teach you the game, but rather a tool to keep track of important mechanics when youâ€™re in the midst of gameplay.

Each page is **colour-coded** for easy navigation and includes **page references** for each of the core rulebooks, making it easy to find the relevant information when you need it.

## Features

- **Quick Reference**: Access important game mechanics and rules quickly during your gameplay.
- **Colour-Coded Pages**: Pages are organized by colour for easy navigation, each section tied to a different aspect of the game.
- **Core Rulebook References**: Every page includes references to the core rulebooks so you can dive deeper into any section when needed.

## Usage

1. Open the datapad in your browser.
2. Navigate through the pages to find the rule or mechanic you're looking for.
